# goTrack

goTrack is a basic Todo app written with a Go Server and Backend, and HTMX + Tailwind for the frontend. 

The app code is very straightforward, thanks to the simplicity of HTMX and Go. Here's some features (pretty self explanatory):

- Add tasks
- Remove tasks
- Mark tasks as done

You can use the application at: https://gotrack.fly.dev/

## Future Features

Future features I plan on adding, just to test my skills and learn something, include:

- Database connection
- Task Sorting
- Task Editing
- Grouping Tasks
- ChatGPT Integration
- Data transfer over HTTPS
- Input Validation/Sanitation
