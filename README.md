# goTrack

Go Track is a basic Todo app written with a Go Server and Backend, and HTMX + Tailwind for the frontend. 

The app code is very straightforward, thanks to the simplicity of HTMX and Go (I love this combo so much). Here's some features (pretty self explanatory):

- Add tasks
- Remove tasks
- Mark tasks as done

## Future Features

Future features I plan on adding, just to test my skills and learn something, include:

- Database connection, probably SQLite
- Hosting Application w/ a backend service
- Task Sorting
- Task Editing
- Grouping Tasks
- ChatGPT Integration
